<p>I recently ported the <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml_step_testbench"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Hardcaml_step_testbench</code>
library</a>, one of the libraries that
we use at Jane Street for Hardcaml simulations, from using monads to using algebraic
effects, a new OCaml 5 feature. This blog post walks through what algebraic effects are,
why you should consider using them in lieu of monads, and how to actually work with them
using the <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/oxcaml_effect"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Handled_effect</code> library</a>. One
thing I&rsquo;ve come to believe is that most of what can be done with monads can be done with
algebraic effects in a much more elegant way.</p>
