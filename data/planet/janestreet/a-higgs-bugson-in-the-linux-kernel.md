<p>We recently ran across a strange higgs-bugson that manifested itself in a critical system that stores and distributes the firm&rsquo;s trading activity data, called Gord. (A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug#Related_terms">higgs-bugson</a> is a bug that is reported in practice but difficult to reproduce, named for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_the_Higgs_boson">Higgs boson</a>, a particle which was theorized in the 1960s but only found in 2013.) In this post I&rsquo;ll walk you through the process I took to debug it. I tried to write down relevant details as they came up, so see if you can guess what the bug is while reading along.</p>
